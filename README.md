# Vagrant Docker Python3

Project that __automates the creation of a `Python 3.10 + Jupyter` local environment__, meant to be used for __learning and testing__ purposes.

Python3 + Jupyter are installed and executed __inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container, inside a VM,
using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) + [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)__.

> With this, __you don't need to install Docker or Python__ on your local computer.  
> __You just need to install Vagrant and VirtualBox__.

## Architecture

Vagrant creates an Ubuntu VM that installs Docker and Docker-Compose, pulls Docker images from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/),
and runs containers with their corresponding port mappings.

Jupyter website will be accessible to the host's web browser through port `8888`.

The automation process is specified using the following files:
1. `Vagrantfile`: Tells Vagrant how to create and configure the VM.
2. `docker-compose.yml`: Tells Docker-Compose which and how containers should be executed.

The following diagram shows the architecture:

![Architecture diagram](docs/diagrams/architecture-diagram.png)

## Prerequisites

* [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation)
* Install the `vagrant-docker-compose` Vagrant plugin:
  ```bash
  vagrant plugin install vagrant-docker-compose
  ```

### Verify installation

Check that the `vagrant` executable was added correctly to the `PATH` variable:
```bash
vagrant version
```

Check that vagrant is able to create a VM:
```bash
mkdir test-vagrant
cd test-vagrant
vagrant init hashicorp/bionic64
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
pwd
exit
vagrant destroy --force
cd ..
rm -rf test-vagrant
```

> ⚠️ If the following error appears after executing `vagrant up`:  
> __`No usable default provider could be found for your system.`__
>
> 1. Verify that VirtualBox was installed correctly
> 2. Obtain more info about the error:
>    ```
>    vagrant up --provider=virtualbox
>    ```

> ⚠️ If the following error appears after executing `vagrant up`:  
> __`VBoxManage: error: Details: code NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005)`__
>
> * Reinstall VirtualBox

Check that the `vagrant-docker-compose` plugin was installed correctly:
```bash
vagrant plugin list | grep "vagrant-docker-compose"
```

## Steps to execute

All the `vagrant` commands must be executed in the host machine from the folder
that contains the Vagrantfile (in this case, the project root folder).

> __ℹ️ Note for Windows users:__
>
> If Vagrant doesn't show any output in the stdout for a Vagrant command after some time,
> press the Enter key or right click in the console window.

### 1. Start the VM [host]

This will install Docker inside that VM, pull the Docker images from DockerHub, and run the containers.

```bash
vagrant up
```

### 2. Check the status of the VM [host]

```bash
vagrant status
```

### 3. Connect to the VM [host]

This connection is done via ssh.

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

### 4. Create tmux session [vm]

The VM welcome message shows the command for connecting to the tmux session.

The tmux window is divided in panes with the following layout:

```
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────────────┐
│    LINUX CLI    │                          │
├─────────────────┤ IPYTHON 3.10 INTERPRETER │
│ JUPYTER-LAB URL │                          │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
```

### 5. Access JupyterLab in your web browser [host]

The URL for accesing JupyterLab will be shown in the `JUPYTER-LAB URL` pane of the tmux session.

Simply copy that URL and paste it in your web browser.

### (Optional) Detach from tmux session [vm]

```bash
Ctrl-B + d
```

### (Optional) Attach again to tmux session [vm]

```bash
tmux list-sessions
tmux attach-session -t <session-name>
```

If the tmux session is deleted (for example, using Ctrl-D several times), you may need to restart the tmux server in
order to be able to connect again to the tmux session:

```bash
tmux kill-server
tmux attach-session -t <session-name>
```

### (Optional) Remove and start containers to clean data [vm]

This is useful if you want to clean the data inside the containers.

```bash
cd /vagrant
docker-compose rm --stop --force
docker-compose up -d
```

### (Optional) Connect to one of the Docker containers [vm]

Obtain the name of the container you want to connect to:
```bash
docker container ls --all
```

> The name is the last column.

Execute the bash command in that container to connect to it:
```bash
docker exec -it <container-name> bash
```

### Stop the VM (keeps data) [host]

Stopping the VM will stop the Docker containers and turn off the VM.  
All the data is persisted inside the containers, and a subsequent turn on of the VM
(and the containers) will have access to that data.

Stop the VM:
```bash
vagrant halt
```

Check the status of the VM:
```bash
vagrant status
```

Start the VM and the containers again:
```bash
vagrant up
```

### Destroy the VM (removes data) [host]

Destroying the VM will remove all the VM data, and therefore, the containers inside it.

This should be the option used if you do not want to keep the data,
and you want to have a "clean" environment in the next turn on of the VM
(because the VM and the containers will be created from scratch).

```bash
vagrant destroy
```

### Additional notes

Whenever you change the `docker-compose.yml` file, you need to run `vagrant reload` to redefine the Vagrant box.

If you need another version of Docker compose, you need to specify the `compose_version` option
in the Vagrantfile (defaults to `1.24.1`), in the `config.vm.provision :docker_compose` line.
